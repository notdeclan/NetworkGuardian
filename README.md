# Network Guardian #

The University of Abertay Dundee (UAD) under the request of Dr Ethan Bayne, assigned the brief for the creation of a
network assessment tool which would provide various important information about any given network. The end users of
the software are aimed towards network administrators, security penetration testers and students of UAD.
A Network Assessment is a detailed report and analysis of any network about its infrastructure, security, the performance,
potential improvements and the current state of the network.
Network administrators and others who work in digital security may face issues when carrying out their roles regarding the
security of the network as the pre-existing, off the shelf products can require a high start-up cost (both monetarily and
timewise), are not as user friendly or flexible as they require, nor do they provide the educational value that our client is
requesting.
This could create a major issue for security professionals as they are faced with either paying for an expensive product or
taking the time to create scripts in order to do their job effectively which may result in turning important tasks (e.g. initial
assessment and enumeration) into something tedious.
Enumeration is a vital first step in assessing networks as it is the process of extracting information about the network (e.g.
hosts, connected devices and user information) from multiple sources which provides a more detailed view of the network.
Unlike these tools, Network Guardian is free, open source, and provides better functionality at the same time. And because
of that, they are able to properly assess the specific network in a quick manner and therefore are able to improve the
overall security of it if needed in a quicker and more efficient way than doing it manually or having to buy an expensive
tool to do the job.
By using Network Guardian, network administrators and security professionals can create their own plugins or use the
standard ones in Network Guardian. This makes it useful, as it provides the ability to fine tune the tool towards the specific
network requirements while keeping the costs low.
When compared with the competition, Network Guardian goes above and beyond in terms of both functionality and user
experience which makes it stand out in the current market with its features.
